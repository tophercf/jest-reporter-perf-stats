# Jest Performance Test Logger

A small custom reporter to optimize the worker count on your laptop, computer, containers, or servers. 
Log simple stats to a `log.csv` file in the root of the repo that is using the custom reporter.
I thought logging to a csv file would be useful, if user wanted to keep info beyond the command line output, for analysis in a spreadsheet program.

Stats recorded: total tests, total suites, total time in seconds, max workers for the run 

## Installing
1. install custom reporter to your repo that you want to benchmark test duration 
`npm i --save-dev jest-reporter-perf-stats`

2. add the custom reporter to your `jest.config.js` 
```
module.exports = {
  ...
  reporters: ['default', 'jest-reporter-perf-stats'],
  ...
};
```
See Jest's [documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#reporters-arraymodulename--modulename-options) for more background on adding custom jest reporters.

3. run the performance benchmark with the included script `node_modules/jest-reporter-perf-stats/scripts/perf.sh`. 
Usage: `./node_modules/jest-reporter-perf-stats/scripts/perf.sh <maxWorkers> <number of iterations>`  
Example: `./node_modules/jest-reporter-perf-stats/scripts/perf.sh 23 3` to run up to 23 max workers in the benchmark, each maxWorker test run will be done 3 times. 

## Contributing
PRs welcome! 

Sanity check that reporter works:
1. install dependencies `npm i`  
2. Run `npm run test_one_worker`  
3. Ensure log.csv outputs correctly and CLI outputs something akin to:
